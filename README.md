## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to practice my data analysis skills. 

I wrote a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) to examine a dataset (.csv) which contains information about college majors and the corresponding salaries of those college majors.

The script contains a set of questions which guided my investigation of the dataset. 

## Usage
Download both files and make sure they are in the same directory. Then, run the Jupyter Notebook file so that each code cell produces the desired outcome.
