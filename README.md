## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to practice my data analysis skills. 

I wrote a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) to analyze a dataset which contains information about college majors and the salaries of graduates who pursued certain majors. 

The script contains a set of questions which guided my analytics of the dataset. 

## Usage
Download both files and make sure they are in the same directory. Then run the Jupyter Notebook file to observe the outcome of each code cell.
